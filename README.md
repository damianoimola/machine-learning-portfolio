This repository is used as high level overview of the projects I've worked on. (NOT FINISHED)

## [Computer-Vision](https://github.com/damianoimola/computer-vision)
- This repository includes two types of computer vision project
  - Image Recognition with Mnist Digit Dataset
  - Image Classification with animal10 dataset (got from a Kaggle's user)

## Natural Language Processing
- Still nothing

## Speech Recognition
- Still nothing

## Machine Learning
- Still nothing

## Others
- [Well-Known Models](https://github.com/damianoimola/DL-Models): This model is used to reproduce some well-known models and approach to some simple problem to solve.
  - ResNet
  - Siamese Network
  - ImoNet (Custom personal Model)
  - Simple classification model
  - Simple localization model
